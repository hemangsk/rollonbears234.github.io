<h4>Personal Blog</h4>

<p>I am creating a blog/personal site for all my interest. I want to share all of the resources I have gathered on tech and other subjects that I enjoy.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

<p>Every day I look on the web for products to improve my workflow on my computer and in my daily life.
I mainly use product hunt and other gear blogs for things to either ogle or download and experiement with.</p>

<p>Up until this point, I save things to pocket, flipboard, my bookmarks, evernote, and wunderlist. This has been fun for me and I feel like I acccumilate more information everyday, but I realize now I have problems synthesiazing that information. I also write in my journal every day, mostly tidbits of advice I gather throughout the day or thoughts/frustrations on products.</p>

<p>This project is to make this information useful not only to me, but other people who check out my site.</p>
